	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>My name is Oluwafolake Ayano. I am a PhD Candidate at Computer and Information Technology Department, Purdue University with research focus on Big Data Analytics. I have had over 10 years of working experience as a Software Developer/Business Analyst with a Leading Financial institution in Nigeria. During this time, I have automated processes that had direct impact on the bottom line of the organization and also worked with huge dataset to uncover novel information, identify patterns and relationships, debug and resolve issues and also provide insight from the data to top level management. I found working with data very interesting and that ignited my passion for my current graduate study in Big Data Analytics and science. 
		
	<br><br>My graduate study has been marked by successful projects and presentations, knowledge of data analytics and expertise in machine learning application. I have taken courses where I garnered deep understanding and obtained practical experience in data wrangling, analysis and using scientific methods and algorithms to extract knowledge and discover new information from raw data. I am prepared to use my skill, motivation, and commitment to make a significant contribution in the next step in my career.</p>
